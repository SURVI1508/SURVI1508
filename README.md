### Sourav - Frontend Developer

👋 Hi, I'm Sourav, a passionate Frontend Developer with over 1.5 year of experience in building dynamic and responsive web applications. My expertise lies in **React.js** and **Next.js**, and I'm skilled in using modern styling frameworks like **Tailwind CSS**, **Bootstrap 5**, and **ShadCN**.

🚀 I'm currently working with startup companies, contributing to various projects such as **edtech**, **ecommerce**, **real estate**, and **car selling** platforms. My ability to quickly adapt and implement new features by reading documentation allows me to deliver high-quality solutions in production environments.

🔧 I'm proficient with tools like **Git**, **GitHub**, **Figma**, and **Jira**. I'm also expanding my skill set by learning **Node.js** for backend development.

📚 While I'm strong in frontend development, I'm actively working on improving my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** skills and **English speaking** abilities.
